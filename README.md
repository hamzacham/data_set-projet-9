IBM Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
This repository contains my project work for the IBM Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python course. This online course, authorized by IBM and offered via Coursera, helped me gain essential skills in working with databases, SQL, and Python for data science tasks.

Project Overview
For the final project, I:

Connected to a relational database using Python.
Created and modified tables in the database.
Wrote SQL queries to extract insights from the data.
Used Python to process and visualize the results.
The project demonstrates the following skills:

Database connection and management.
Data retrieval and manipulation using SQL.
Python integration for database operations and data analysis.
